                <h2>Facts About Dogs</h2>
                <p>Dogs are domesticated mammals descended from wolves and have lived alongside humans for at least 15,000 years. They have an extraordinary sense of smell, up to 100,000 times stronger than humans, which makes them excellent at tracking, search-and-rescue, and detecting diseases. Dogs communicate using body language, vocal sounds, and facial expressions. They are highly intelligent and can be trained to perform complex tasks. Different breeds vary greatly in size, lifespan, and behavior. Dogs are social animals that form strong emotional bonds with humans and often show loyalty, empathy, and protective instincts toward their owners

                <p> A study was conducted on dogs being away from their owners for varying hours and the studies show that dogs who were away from their owners the longest showed the greatest amount of affection!
